# MP3Journaling
This app is meant to be used in conjunction with a SONY TX660. The intention is to be able to record your entire day in a single MP3 file (can actually be multiple files) and leave track marks where you had an idea and said it out loud or had a very intersting conversation with someone and want to keep a record of it without having to stop, take out your digital recorder and repeat the idea again or list the important point of a conversation out loud. It is meant to be a discreet way to journal without interrupting your daily life. In effect, it will split an MP3 file based on track marks left in it using the TX660.

## Possible track mark pattern

1. T: marks the last X minutes as IMPORTANT_THOUGHT
2. TT: marks the last Y minutes as IMPORTANT_THOUGHT_LONG
3. TTT-T marks whatever is in between the three first and last track mark as IMPORTANT_CONVERSATION
4. TTTT-T marks whatever is in between the four first and last track mark as CONFIDENTIAL (aka. must be deleted if it is included in any other recording via overlapping)
5. TTTTT marks the last 5 minutes as a PROJECT_IDEA

Where T represent a track mark and - a segment in time of any lenght.

Track marks group should appear in a maximum interval of 30 seconds. That is, if you want to put three track mark in a row, the distance in time between the first and last one should not exceed 30 seconds.


### Other important information
Be nice, don't just mark other peoples idea or remarks as something to record without their consent, this is meant as quicker and reliable PERSONNAL journaling method (of course if someone says something you think is intersting, ask them if you can save it and if they agree, you can save it for yourself)
